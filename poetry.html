        <h3>Troubled youth </h3>
        <h4> June 2,2023 </h4>

    <p> I am troubled by the disillusion of my own self 
        to tract down the piety of my own youth
        troubled youth with remedies of pleading shame
    haunted , the dimension of my own conscious,
whole faction disthrought by my being ,
held hostage ,
I no longer desire the old remedy of summer nights and troubled affection 
I am in shame , batch of women at ease with the objectification of my pain , 
Many doubts respond to the actions that lead me into lost years , 
stumbling about to find favor in the eyes of my own reflection . 

</p>
   
The stress takes a toll<Br.
A bouncing ball takes itâ€™s mark ,<br>
And the moments gone ,<br>
Questions of rare integrity shake the response of neglect ,<br>
Whole minds at war yet the very mind finds its rest,<br>
Middle wars , anxious pariah and a distinct aim ,<br>
 soon the open market and recent grads astound the world , <br>
 stress takes a toll upon most competitive breaks . <br>

<h3>Dont mock me  </h3>
<h4> May 31,2023</h4>
<p> Years of therapy,
    self critism ,
    and muses milk ,
    the old greetings of dust to dust, 
    seek to acknowledge the by product of inspiration ,
    I withhold the gaze , 
    my sheltering force has shamed the old me ,

<h3> Faultless and Oppressed <br> By Luis Santiago  <br></h3>
<p> Its not your fault they chose to not get to know you ,<br>
    its not your fault they chose another man , <br>
    its not your fault they chose to treat you bad , <br>
    its not your fault they bet on the wrong horse , <br>

<h3>Dont do anything useful by luis santiago </h3>
<p> broken shadows that make me cry ,<br>
    why does the distance spacing unobtained knowledge,<br>
    fill my nervous system with dopamine ,<br>
    Yet it lacks that lust,<br>
    I cry out my sadness voids my inner being ,<br>
    to joy the aspects of time ,<br>
    oh doom me ,<br>
    I shall do nothing useful .<br>

    <h3> Nectar of a lost child by luis santiago </h3>
    <h4> Sunday May 14,2023</h4>
    <p>The terrible trust in the lackness of possession <br>
        when denying the nectar of a friend ,<br>
        Many doubt the response of trusting another, <br>
        laying up with the mountains facing out , <br>
        Why have I lost myself , <br>
        raising up a jinx ,<br>
        a troubled child a lost child facing up ,<br>
        with a odd grasp on faith , <br>
        Not a single drop of mothers nectar wasted <br>
        Now I the lost child faces down<br>
        why do I look down ?<br>
        seeking to uphold the next ,<br>
        is my nectar nutriousment?<br>
        Can my nectar feed the sheep ?<br>
        (Happy mothers day! )<br>

<h3> blooming frowns  </h3>
<h4>Monday May 8,2023</h4>
<p> Ripe but despite my urges to succeed ,<br>
    I encounter many forms of alternatives ,<br>
    spiked and caffeinated mood enhancers,<br>
    oh my blooming mind awaits mightiness,<br>
    yet the shading algorithm of my daily sense ,<br>
    makes my withering body break into deep sleep ,<br>
    I too imitate the withering afternoon ,<br>
    with gestures of mockey that drape my sterness <br>
    unawaited the fields ,<br>
    mocking me in my destress <br>
    sadly the details about me <br>
    every nerve and destressed speckle <br>
    makes a boy cry and a old enough gentleman frown, <br>
    drinking to avoid idleness ,<br> 
    I too am haunted to labour.<br>

    <h3> A  thought of wine by luis santiago</h3>
<h4>Sunday May 7, 2023</h4>
<p> A solid appetite weakens me ,<br>
    but in the darkness I experience void ,<br> 
    many kept a breathen of a watch ,<br> 
    even shadows of the nusance ,<br>
    in the name of justice ,<br>
    seek to uphold for my life ,<br>
    although I reek and despair,<br>
    the trip has made me something ,<br>
    for not bargining with the devil,<br>
    I suffer of antiqueness and shame <br>
